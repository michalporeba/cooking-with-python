From zero to hero in Python, step at a time. 

# Steps

## Step 01

Objective: Basic command line application in python

Create an application that stores recipes for a few (at least 3) dishes or cakes. At this stage each recipe will have a name, and a brief description. When the programme starts it should display a list of all known recipes by name after its number and ask which recipe would the user want to see the details off. Once the user povides the number the details should be displayed. 

Some extra things to consider:
* Some recipes should not have a description at all. Make sure the application still works well. 
* What is the user enters number not only the list? Or perhaps not a number at all? 
* Can you make the application ask the question multiple times? 

## Step 02 

Objective: Read recipes data from a simple text file

Extend the previous application so that the recipes data is read from a text file of some sort. Try making up a data format.
